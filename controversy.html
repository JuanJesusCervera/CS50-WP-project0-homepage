      <h1>Lovers of Teruel: Controversy</h1>
      <p>Many scholars have debated the authenticity of the Lovers of Teruel. Their reason is that in 1353 the Italian Boccaccio told practically the same tale under the name Girolamo e Salvestra, although he had some additional material in his story. In Boccaccio's version the erotic is stressed in the additional material. Logically (as James Michener argued in his book Iberia), it is more likely that the erotic version came second; it is difficult to find instances in which popular taste borrowed an erotic tale from a professional writer, sanitised it and then claimed it to be a traditional folk tale. It is unlikely that the simple folk of Teruel borrow a naughty take from Boccaccio and cleaned it up in their retelling; whereas it would be reasonable to say that a professional and sophisticated writer of Boccaccio's skill could borrow a sentimental folk tale emanating from Teruel and introduce the erotic elements in his version. Therefore, it seems much more likely that it was Boccaccio who did the borrowing. Throughout history, other cultures have had similar tales of forbidden love, such as Hero and Leander and Romeo and Juliet.</p>
